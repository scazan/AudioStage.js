AudioStage.js
=============

A sound cueing and playback library for Google Chrome to easily map soundfiles to named events via a configuration file. 

Initially written for an upcoming JavaScript video game, the library was written with the sound designer in mind, enabling a designer to easily add and map sounds events and apply sound processing via a simple configuration file (JSON).
